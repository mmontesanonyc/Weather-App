# My Weather App
Because all of the weather websites try to be everything to everybody, I suspect that they are useless to most. I longed for a clean interface that showed me some forecast basics: temperature, conditions, and precip change. I longed to check the weather without having to close a dozen pop-up ads. 

So I built [the Weather App that I wanted](https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/Weather-App/). If you like it and use it (which, frankly, would make me chuffed beyond belief), then [feel free to Venmo me a few bucks](https://venmo.com/code?user_id=2293559168335872144&created=1739136186) - it's cheaper than subscribing to any of the Weather Company's add-free services.

This uses:
- Browser geocoding (or a ZIP Code query: for now, it only works in the USA)
- The weatherapi.com weather api
- Basic Bootstrap and JavaScript

If you seriously like this and would like me to develop it further, feel free to file an issue with any ideas, suggestions, or desires.
